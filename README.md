# vim-playlist
Use vim as a front-end to mpg123

# Why?
The line of reasoning that has led me to this point can be summarized as:

 #. iTunes sucks
 #. So apparently does everything else
 #. mpg123 is usable, mostly...
 #. ...except the console controls aren't reading keyboard events right on my
    terminal, and frankly are pretty minimal anyway
 #. The FIFO controls are working fine though
 #. I should just write a script to manage the FIFO controls
 #. It would be sweet if that script had a playlist editor
 #. Even writing a minimal editor is a ton of work
